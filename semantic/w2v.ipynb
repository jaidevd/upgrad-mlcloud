      "India Hindi Bhārat officially the Republic of India Hindi Bhārat Gaṇarājya is a country in South Asia It is the second most populous country the seventh largest country by land area and the most populous democracy in the world Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south the Arabian Sea on the southwest and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west China Nepal and Bhutan to the north and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east In the Indian Ocean India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55 000 years ago Their long occupation initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter gatherers has made the region highly diverse second only to Africa in human genetic diversity Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9 000 years ago evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE By 1200 BCE an archaic form of Sanskrit an Indo European language had diffused into India from the northwest unfolding as the language of the Rigveda and recording the dawning of Hinduism in India The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern and western regions By 400 BCE stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin Their collective era was suffused with wide ranging creativity but also marked by the declining status of women and the incorporation of untouchability into an organised system of belief In South India the Middle kingdoms exported Dravidian languages scripts and religious cultures to the kingdoms of Southeast Asia In the early medieval era Christianity Islam Judaism and Zoroastrianism put down roots on India s southern and western coasts Muslim armies from Central Asia intermittently overran India s northern plains eventually establishing the Delhi Sultanate and drawing northern India into the cosmopolitan networks of medieval Islam In the 15th century the Vijayanagara Empire created a long lasting composite Hindu culture in south India In the Punjab Sikhism emerged rejecting institutionalised religion The Mughal Empire in 1526 ushered in two centuries of relative peace leaving a legacy of luminous architecture Gradually expanding rule of the British East India Company followed turning India into a colonial economy but also consolidating its sovereignty British Crown rule began in 1858 The rights promised to Indians were granted slowly but technological changes were introduced and ideas of education modernity and the public life took root A pioneering and influential nationalist movement emerged which was noted for nonviolent resistance and became the major factor in ending British rule In 1947 the British Indian Empire was partitioned into two independent dominions a Hindu majority Dominion of India and a Muslim majority Dominion of Pakistan amid large scale loss of life and an unprecedented migration India has been a secular federal republic since 1950 governed in a democratic parliamentary system It is a pluralistic multilingual and multi ethnic society India s population grew from 361 million in 1951 to 1 211 billion in 2011 During the same time its nominal per capita income increased from US 64 annually to US 1 498 and its literacy rate from 16 6 to 74 From being a comparatively destitute country in 1951 India has become a fast growing major economy and a hub for information technology services with an expanding middle class It has a space programme which includes several planned or completed extraterrestrial missions Indian movies music and spiritual teachings play an increasing role in global culture India has substantially reduced its rate of poverty though at the cost of increasing economic inequality India is a nuclear weapon state which ranks high in military expenditure It has disputes over Kashmir with its neighbours Pakistan and China unresolved since the mid 20th century Among the socio economic challenges India faces are gender inequality child malnutrition and rising levels of air pollution India s land is megadiverse with four biodiversity hotspots Its forest cover comprises 21 4 of its area India s wildlife which has traditionally been viewed with tolerance in India s culture is supported among these forests and elsewhere in protected habitats Etymology According to the Oxford English Dictionary third edition 2009 the name India is derived from the Classical Latin India a reference to South Asia and an uncertain region to its east and in turn derived successively from Hellenistic Greek India Ἰνδία ancient Greek Indos Ἰνδός Old Persian Hindush an eastern province of the Achaemenid empire and ultimately its cognate the Sanskrit Sindhu or river specifically the Indus river and by implication its well settled southern basin The ancient Greeks referred to the Indians as Indoi Ἰνδοί which translates as The people of the Indus The term Bharat Bhārat pronounced ˈbʱaːɾət listen mentioned in both Indian epic poetry and the Constitution of India is used in its variations by many Indian languages A modern rendering of the historical name Bharatavarsha which applied originally to a region of the Gangetic Valley Bharat gained increased currency from the mid 19th century as a native name for India Hindustan ɦɪndʊˈstaːn listen is a Middle Persian name for India introduced during the Mughal Empire and used widely since Its meaning has varied referring to a region encompassing present day northern India and Pakistan or to India in its near entirety History Ancient India By 55 000 years ago the first modern humans or Homo sapiens had arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa where they had earlier evolved The earliest known modern human remains in South Asia date to about 30 000 years ago After 6500 BCE evidence for domestication of food crops and animals construction of permanent structures and storage of agricultural surplus appeared in Mehrgarh and other sites in what is now Balochistan Pakistan These gradually developed into the Indus Valley Civilisation the first urban culture in South Asia which flourished during 2500 1900 BCE in what is now Pakistan and western India Centred around cities such as Mohenjo daro Harappa Dholavira and Kalibangan and relying on varied forms of subsistence the civilisation engaged robustly in crafts production and wide ranging trade During the period 2000 500 BCE many regions of the subcontinent transitioned from the Chalcolithic cultures to the Iron Age ones The Vedas the oldest scriptures associated with Hinduism were composed during this period and historians have analysed these to posit a Vedic culture in the Punjab region and the upper Gangetic Plain Most historians also consider this period to have encompassed several waves of Indo Aryan migration into the subcontinent from the north west The caste system which created a hierarchy of priests warriors and free peasants but which excluded indigenous peoples by labelling their occupations impure arose during this period On the Deccan Plateau archaeological evidence from this period suggests the existence of a chiefdom stage of political organisation In South India a progression to sedentary life is indicated by the large number of megalithic monuments dating from this period as well as by nearby traces of agriculture irrigation tanks and craft traditions In the late Vedic period around the 6th century BCE the small states and chiefdoms of the Ganges Plain and the north western regions had consolidated into 16 major oligarchies and monarchies that were known as the mahajanapadas The emerging urbanisation gave rise to non Vedic religious movements two of which became independent religions Jainism came into prominence during the life of its exemplar Mahavira Buddhism based on the teachings of Gautama Buddha attracted followers from all social classes excepting the middle class chronicling the life of the Buddha was central to the beginnings of recorded history in India In an age of increasing urban wealth both religions held up renunciation as an ideal and both established long lasting monastic traditions Politically by the 3rd century BCE the kingdom of Magadha had annexed or reduced other states to emerge as the Mauryan Empire The empire was once thought to have controlled most of the subcontinent except the far south but its core regions are now thought to have been separated by large autonomous areas The Mauryan kings are known as much for their empire building and determined management of public life as for Ashoka s renunciation of militarism and far flung advocacy of the Buddhist dhamma The Sangam literature of the Tamil language reveals that between 200 BCE and 200 CE the southern peninsula was ruled by the Cheras the Cholas and the Pandyas dynasties that traded extensively with the Roman Empire and with West and South East Asia In North India Hinduism asserted patriarchal control within the family leading to increased subordination of women By the 4th and 5th centuries the Gupta Empire had created a complex system of administration and taxation in the greater Ganges Plain this system became a model for later Indian kingdoms Under the Guptas a renewed Hinduism based on devotion rather than the management of ritual began to assert itself This renewal was reflected in a flowering of sculpture and architecture which found patrons among an urban elite Classical Sanskrit literature flowered as well and Indian science astronomy medicine and mathematics made significant advances Medieval India The Indian early medieval age 600 CE to 1200 CE is defined by regional kingdoms and cultural diversity When Harsha of Kannauj who ruled much of the Indo Gangetic Plain from 606 to 647 CE attempted to expand southwards he was defeated by the Chalukya ruler of the Deccan When his successor attempted to expand eastwards he was defeated by the Pala king of Bengal When the Chalukyas attempted to expand southwards they were defeated by the Pallavas from farther south who in turn were opposed by the Pandyas and the Cholas from still farther south No ruler of this period was able to create an empire and consistently control lands much beyond his core region During this time pastoral peoples whose land had been cleared to make way for the growing agricultural economy were accommodated within caste society as were new non traditional ruling classes The caste system consequently began to show regional differences In the 6th and 7th centuries the first devotional hymns were created in the Tamil language They were imitated all over India and led to both the resurgence of Hinduism and the development of all modern languages of the subcontinent Indian royalty big and small and the temples they patronised drew citizens in great numbers to the capital cities which became economic hubs as well Temple towns of various sizes began to appear everywhere as India underwent another urbanisation By the 8th and 9th centuries the effects were felt in South East Asia as South Indian culture and political systems were exported to lands that became part of modern day Myanmar Thailand Laos Cambodia Vietnam Philippines Malaysia and Java Indian merchants scholars and sometimes armies were involved in this transmission South East Asians took the initiative as well with many sojourning in Indian seminaries and translating Buddhist and Hindu texts into their languages After the 10th century Muslim Central Asian nomadic clans using swift horse cavalry and raising vast armies united by ethnicity and religion repeatedly overran South Asia s north western plains leading eventually to the establishment of the Islamic Delhi Sultanate in 1206 The sultanate was to control much of North India and to make many forays into South India Although at first disruptive for the Indian elites the sultanate largely left its vast non Muslim subject population to its own laws and customs By repeatedly repulsing Mongol raiders in the 13th century the sultanate saved India from the devastation visited on West and Central Asia setting the scene for centuries of migration of fleeing soldiers learned men mystics traders artists and artisans from that region into the subcontinent thereby creating a syncretic Indo Islamic culture in the north The sultanate s raiding and weakening of the regional kingdoms of South India paved the way for the indigenous Vijayanagara Empire Embracing a strong Shaivite tradition and building upon the military technology of the sultanate the empire came to control much of peninsular India and was to influence South Indian society for long afterwards Early modern India In the early 16th century northern India then under mainly Muslim rulers fell again to the superior mobility and firepower of a new generation of Central Asian warriors The resulting Mughal Empire did not stamp out the local societies it came to rule Instead it balanced and pacified them through new administrative practices and diverse and inclusive ruling elites leading to more systematic centralised and uniform rule Eschewing tribal bonds and Islamic identity especially under Akbar the Mughals united their far flung realms through loyalty expressed through a Persianised culture to an emperor who had near divine status The Mughal state s economic policies deriving most revenues from agriculture and mandating that taxes be paid in the well regulated silver currency caused peasants and artisans to enter larger markets The relative peace maintained by the empire during much of the 17th century was a factor in India s economic expansion resulting in greater patronage of painting literary forms textiles and architecture Newly coherent social groups in northern and western India such as the Marathas the Rajputs and the Sikhs gained military and governing ambitions during Mughal rule which through collaboration or adversity gave them both recognition and military experience Expanding commerce during Mughal rule gave rise to new Indian commercial and political elites along the coasts of southern and eastern India As the empire disintegrated many among these elites were able to seek and control their own affairs By the early 18th century with the lines between commercial and political dominance being increasingly blurred a number of European trading companies including the English East India Company had established coastal outposts The East India Company s control of the seas greater resources and more advanced military training and technology led it to increasingly flex its military muscle and caused it to become attractive to a portion of the Indian elite these factors were crucial in allowing the company to gain control over the Bengal region by 1765 and sideline the other European companies Its further access to the riches of Bengal and the subsequent increased strength and size of its army enabled it to annexe or subdue most of India by the 1820s India was then no longer exporting manufactured goods as it long had but was instead supplying the British Empire with raw materials Many historians consider this to be the onset of India s colonial period By this time with its economic power severely curtailed by the British parliament and having effectively been made an arm of British administration the company began more consciously to enter non economic arenas like education social reform and culture Modern India Historians consider India s modern age to have begun sometime between 1848 and 1885 The appointment in 1848 of Lord Dalhousie as Governor General of the East India Company set the stage for changes essential to a modern state These included the consolidation and demarcation of sovereignty the surveillance of the population and the education of citizens Technological changes among them railways canals and the telegraph were introduced not long after their introduction in Europe However disaffection with the company also grew during this time and set off the Indian Rebellion of 1857 Fed by diverse resentments and perceptions including invasive British style social reforms harsh land taxes and summary treatment of some rich landowners and princes the rebellion rocked many regions of northern and central India and shook the foundations of Company rule Although the rebellion was suppressed by 1858 it led to the dissolution of the East India Company and the direct administration of India by the British government Proclaiming a unitary state and a gradual but limited British style parliamentary system the new rulers also protected princes and landed gentry as a feudal safeguard against future unrest In the decades following public life gradually emerged all over India leading eventually to the founding of the Indian National Congress in 1885 The rush of technology and the commercialisation of agriculture in the second half of the 19th century was marked by economic setbacks and many small farmers became dependent on the whims of far away markets There was an increase in the number of large scale famines and despite the risks of infrastructure development borne by Indian taxpayers little industrial employment was generated for Indians There were also salutary effects commercial cropping especially in the newly canalled Punjab led to increased food production for internal consumption The railway network provided critical famine relief notably reduced the cost of moving goods and helped nascent Indian owned industry After World War I in which approximately one million Indians served a new period began It was marked by British reforms but also repressive legislation by more strident Indian calls for self rule and by the beginnings of a nonviolent movement of non co operation of which Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi would become the leader and enduring symbol During the 1930s slow legislative reform was enacted by the British the Indian National Congress won victories in the resulting elections The next decade was beset with crises Indian participation in World War II the Congress s final push for non co operation and an upsurge of Muslim nationalism All were capped by the advent of independence in 1947 but tempered by the partition of India into two states India and Pakistan Vital to India s self image as an independent nation was its constitution completed in 1950 which put in place a secular and democratic republic It has remained a democracy with civil liberties an active Supreme Court and a largely independent press Economic liberalisation which began in the 1990s has created a large urban middle class transformed India into one of the world s fastest growing economies and increased its geopolitical clout Indian movies music and spiritual teachings play an increasing role in global culture Yet India is also shaped by seemingly unyielding poverty both rural and urban by religious and caste related violence by Maoist inspired Naxalite insurgencies and by separatism in Jammu and Kashmir and in Northeast India It has unresolved territorial disputes with China and with Pakistan India s sustained democratic freedoms are unique among the world s newer nations however in spite of its recent economic successes freedom from want for its disadvantaged population remains a goal yet to be achieved Geography India accounts for the bulk of the Indian subcontinent lying atop the Indian tectonic plate a part of the Indo Australian Plate India s defining geological processes began 75 million years ago when the Indian Plate then part of the southern supercontinent Gondwana began a north eastward drift caused by seafloor spreading to its south west and later south and south east Simultaneously the vast Tethyan oceanic crust to its northeast began to subduct under the Eurasian Plate These dual processes driven by convection in the Earth s mantle both created the Indian Ocean and caused the Indian continental crust eventually to under thrust Eurasia and to uplift the Himalayas Immediately south of the emerging Himalayas plate movement created a vast trough that rapidly filled with river borne sediment and now constitutes the Indo Gangetic Plain Cut off from the plain by the ancient Aravalli Range lies the Thar Desert The original Indian Plate survives as peninsular India the oldest and geologically most stable part of India It extends as far north as the Satpura and Vindhya ranges in central India These parallel chains run from the Arabian Sea coast in Gujarat in the west to the coal rich Chota Nagpur Plateau in Jharkhand in the east To the south the remaining peninsular landmass the Deccan Plateau is flanked on the west and east by coastal ranges known as the Western and Eastern Ghats the plateau contains the country s oldest rock formations some over one billion years old Constituted in such fashion India lies to the north of the equator between 6 44 and 35 30 north latitude and 68 7 and 97 25 east longitude India s coastline measures 7 517 kilometres 4 700 mi in length of this distance 5 423 kilometres 3 400 mi belong to peninsular India and 2 094 kilometres 1 300 mi to the Andaman Nicobar and Lakshadweep island chains According to the Indian naval hydrographic charts the mainland coastline consists of the following 43 sandy beaches 11 rocky shores including cliffs and 46 mudflats or marshy shores Major Himalayan origin rivers that substantially flow through India include the Ganges and the Brahmaputra both of which drain into the Bay of Bengal Important tributaries of the Ganges include the Yamuna and the Kosi the latter s extremely low gradient caused by long term silt deposition leads to severe floods and course changes Major peninsular rivers whose steeper gradients prevent their waters from flooding include the Godavari the Mahanadi the Kaveri and the Krishna which also drain into the Bay of Bengal and the Narmada and the Tapti which drain into the Arabian Sea Coastal features include the marshy Rann of Kutch of western India and the alluvial Sundarbans delta of eastern India the latter is shared with Bangladesh India has two archipelagos the Lakshadweep coral atolls off India s south western coast and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands a volcanic chain in the Andaman Sea The Indian climate is strongly influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert both of which drive the economically and culturally pivotal summer and winter monsoons The Himalayas prevent cold Central Asian katabatic winds from blowing in keeping the bulk of the Indian subcontinent warmer than most locations at similar latitudes The Thar Desert plays a crucial role in attracting the moisture laden south west summer monsoon winds that between June and October provide the majority of India s rainfall Four major climatic groupings predominate in India tropical wet tropical dry subtropical humid and montane Biodiversity India is a megadiverse country a term employed for 17 countries which display high biological diversity and contain many species exclusively indigenous or endemic to them India is a habitat for 8 6 of all mammal species 13 7 of bird species 7 9 of reptile species 6 of amphibian species 12 2 of fish species and 6 0 of all flowering plant species Fully a third of Indian plant species are endemic India also contains four of the world s 34 biodiversity hotspots or regions that display significant habitat loss in the presence of high endemism India s forest cover is 701 673 km2 270 917 sq mi which is 21 35 of the country s total land area It can be subdivided further into broad categories of canopy density or the proportion of the area of a forest covered by its tree canopy Very dense forest whose canopy density is greater than 70 occupies 2 61 of India s land area It predominates in the tropical moist forest of the Andaman Islands the Western Ghats and Northeast India Moderately dense forest whose canopy density is between 40 and 70 occupies 9 59 of India s land area It predominates in the temperate coniferous forest of the Himalayas the moist deciduous sal forest of eastern India and the dry deciduous teak forest of central and southern India Open forest whose canopy density is between 10 and 40 occupies 9 14 of India s land area and predominates in the babul dominated thorn forest of the central Deccan Plateau and the western Gangetic plain Among the Indian subcontinent s notable indigenous trees are the astringent Azadirachta indica or neem which is widely used in rural Indian herbal medicine and the luxuriant Ficus religiosa or peepul which is displayed on the ancient seals of Mohenjo daro and under which the Buddha is recorded in the Pali canon to have sought enlightenment Many Indian species have descended from those of Gondwana the southern supercontinent from which India separated more than 100 million years ago India s subsequent collision with Eurasia set off a mass exchange of species However volcanism and climatic changes later caused the extinction of many endemic Indian forms Still later mammals entered India from Asia through two zoogeographical passes flanking the Himalayas This had the effect of lowering endemism among India s mammals which stands at 12 6 contrasting with 45 8 among reptiles and 55 8 among amphibians Notable endemics are the vulnerable hooded leaf monkey and the threatened Beddom s toad of the Western Ghats India contains 172 IUCN designated threatened animal species or 2 9 of endangered forms These include the endangered Bengal tiger and the Ganges river dolphin Critically endangered species include the gharial a crocodilian the great Indian bustard and the Indian white rumped vulture which has become nearly extinct by having ingested the carrion of diclofenac treated cattle The pervasive and ecologically devastating human encroachment of recent decades has critically endangered Indian wildlife In response the system of national parks and protected areas first established in 1935 was expanded substantially In 1972 India enacted the Wildlife Protection Act and Project Tiger to safeguard crucial wilderness the Forest Conservation Act was enacted in 1980 and amendments added in 1988 India hosts more than five hundred wildlife sanctuaries and thirteen biosphere reserves four of which are part of the World Network of Biosphere Reserves twenty five wetlands are registered under the Ramsar Convention Politics and government Politics India is the world s most populous democracy A parliamentary republic with a multi party system it has eight recognised national parties including the Indian National Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party BJP and more than 40 regional parties The Congress is considered centre left in Indian political culture and the BJP right wing For most of the period between 1950 when India first became a republic and the late 1980s the Congress held a majority in the parliament Since then however it has increasingly shared the political stage with the BJP as well as with powerful regional parties which have often forced the creation of multi party coalition governments at the centre In the Republic of India s first three general elections in 1951 1957 and 1962 the Jawaharlal Nehru led Congress won easy victories On Nehru s death in 1964 Lal Bahadur Shastri briefly became prime minister he was succeeded after his own unexpected death in 1966 by Nehru s daughter Indira Gandhi who went on to lead the Congress to election victories in 1967 and 1971 Following public discontent with the state of emergency she declared in 1975 the Congress was voted out of power in 1977 the then new Janata Party which had opposed the emergency was voted in Its government lasted just over two years Voted back into power in 1980 the Congress saw a change in leadership in 1984 when Indira Gandhi was assassinated she was succeeded by her son Rajiv Gandhi who won an easy victory in the general elections later that year The Congress was voted out again in 1989 when a National Front coalition led by the newly formed Janata Dal in alliance with the Left Front won the elections that government too proved relatively short lived lasting just under two years Elections were held again in 1991 no party won an absolute majority The Congress as the largest single party was able to form a minority government led by P V Narasimha Rao A two year period of political turmoil followed the general election of 1996 Several short lived alliances shared power at the centre The BJP formed a government briefly in 1996 it was followed by two comparatively long lasting United Front coalitions which depended on external support In 1998 the BJP was able to form a successful coalition the National Democratic Alliance NDA Led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee the NDA became the first non Congress coalition government to complete a five year term Again in the 2004 Indian general elections no party won an absolute majority but the Congress emerged as the largest single party forming another successful coalition the United Progressive Alliance UPA It had the support of left leaning parties and MPs who opposed the BJP The UPA returned to power in the 2009 general election with increased numbers and it no longer required external support from India s communist parties That year Manmohan Singh became the first prime minister since Jawaharlal Nehru in 1957 and 1962 to be re elected to a consecutive five year term In the 2014 general election the BJP became the first political party since 1984 to win a majority and govern without the support of other parties The incumbent prime minister is Narendra Modi a former chief minister of Gujarat On 20 July 2017 Ram Nath Kovind was elected India s 14th president and took the oath of office on 25 July 2017 Government India is a federation with a parliamentary system governed under the Constitution of India the country s supreme legal document It is a constitutional republic and representative democracy in which majority rule is tempered by minority rights protected by law Federalism in India defines the power distribution between the union and the states The Constitution of India which came into effect on 26 January 1950 originally stated India to be a sovereign democratic republic this characterisation was amended in 1971 to a sovereign socialist secular democratic republic India s form of government traditionally described as quasi federal with a strong centre and weak states has grown increasingly federal since the late 1990s as a result of political economic and social changes The Government of India comprises three branches Executive The President of India is the ceremonial head of state who is elected indirectly for a five year term by an electoral college comprising members of national and state legislatures The Prime Minister of India is the head of government and exercises most executive power Appointed by the president the prime minister is by convention supported by the party or political alliance having a majority of seats in the lower house of parliament The executive of the Indian government consists of the president the vice president and the Union Council of Ministers with the cabinet being its executive committee headed by the prime minister Any minister holding a portfolio must be a member of one of the houses of parliament In the Indian parliamentary system the executive is subordinate to the legislature the prime minister and their council are directly responsible to the lower house of the parliament Civil servants act as permanent executives and all decisions of the executive are implemented by them Legislature The legislature of India is the bicameral parliament Operating under a Westminster style parliamentary system it comprises an upper house called the Rajya Sabha Council of States and a lower house called the Lok Sabha House of the People The Rajya Sabha is a permanent body of 245 members who serve staggered six year terms Most are elected indirectly by the state and union territorial legislatures in numbers proportional to their state s share of the national population All but two of the Lok Sabha s 545 members are elected directly by popular vote they represent single member constituencies for five year terms Two seats of parliament reserved for Anglo Indian in the article 331 have been scrapped Judiciary India has a three tier unitary independent judiciary comprising the supreme court headed by the Chief Justice of India 25 high courts and a large number of trial courts The supreme court has original jurisdiction over cases involving fundamental rights and over disputes between states and the centre and has appellate jurisdiction over the high courts It has the power to both strike down union or state laws which contravene the constitution and invalidate any government action it deems unconstitutional Administrative divisions India is a federal union comprising 28 states and 8 union territories listed below as 1 28 and A H respectively All states as well as the union territories of Jammu and Kashmir Puducherry and the National Capital Territory of Delhi have elected legislatures and governments following the Westminster system of governance The remaining five union territories are directly ruled by the central government through appointed administrators In 1956 under the States Reorganisation Act states were reorganised on a linguistic basis There are over a quarter of a million local government bodies at city town block district and village levels Foreign economic and strategic relations In the 1950s India strongly supported decolonisation in Africa and Asia and played a leading role in the Non Aligned Movement After initially cordial relations with neighbouring China India went to war with China in 1962 and was widely thought to have been humiliated India has had tense relations with neighbouring Pakistan the two nations have gone to war four times in 1947 1965 1971 and 1999 Three of these wars were fought over the disputed territory of Kashmir while the fourth the 1971 war followed from India s support for the independence of Bangladesh In the late 1980s the Indian military twice intervened abroad at the invitation of the host country a peace keeping operation in Sri Lanka between 1987 and 1990 and an armed intervention to prevent a 1988 coup d état attempt in the Maldives After the 1965 war with Pakistan India began to pursue close military and economic ties with the Soviet Union by the late 1960s the Soviet Union was its largest arms supplier Aside from ongoing its special relationship with Russia India has wide ranging defence relations with Israel and France In recent years it has played key roles in the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation and the World Trade Organization The nation has provided 100 000 military and police personnel to serve in 35 UN peacekeeping operations across four continents It participates in the East Asia Summit the G8 5 and other multilateral forums India has close economic ties with countries in South America Asia and Africa it pursues a Look East policy that seeks to strengthen partnerships with the ASEAN nations Japan and South Korea that revolve around many issues but especially those involving economic investment and regional security China s nuclear test of 1964 as well as its repeated threats to intervene in support of Pakistan in the 1965 war convinced India to develop nuclear weapons India conducted its first nuclear weapons test in 1974 and carried out additional underground testing in 1998 Despite criticism and military sanctions India has signed neither the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty nor the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty considering both to be flawed and discriminatory India maintains a no first use nuclear policy and is developing a nuclear triad capability as a part of its Minimum Credible Deterrence doctrine It is developing a ballistic missile defence shield and a fifth generation fighter jet Other indigenous military projects involve the design and implementation of Vikrant class aircraft carriers and Arihant class nuclear submarines Since the end of the Cold War India has increased its economic strategic and military co operation with the United States and the European Union In 2008 a civilian nuclear agreement was signed between India and the United States Although India possessed nuclear weapons at the time and was not a party to the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty it received waivers from the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Nuclear Suppliers Group ending earlier restrictions on India s nuclear technology and commerce As a consequence India became the sixth de facto nuclear weapons state India subsequently signed co operation agreements involving civilian nuclear energy with Russia France the United Kingdom and Canada The President of India is the supreme commander of the nation s armed forces with 1 395 million active troops they compose the world s second largest

stood at US 72 7 billion In 2011 the annual defence budget increased by 11 6 although this does not include funds that reach the military through other branches of government As of 2012 India is the world s largest arms importer between 2007 and 2011 it accounted for 10 of funds spent on international arms purchases Much of the military expenditure was focused on defence against Pakistan and countering growing Chinese influence in the Indian Ocean In May 2017 the Indian Space Research Organisation launched the South Asia Satellite a gift from India to its neighbouring SAARC countries In October 2018 India signed a US 5 43 billion over 400 billion agreement with Russia to procure four S 400 Triumf surface to air missile defence systems Russia s most advanced long range missile defence system Economy According to the International Monetary Fund IMF the Indian economy in 2019 was nominally worth 2 9 trillion it is the fifth largest economy by market exchange rates and is around 11 trillion the third largest by purchasing power parity PPP With its average annual GDP growth rate of 5 8 over the past two decades and reaching 6 1 during 2011 2012 India is one of the world s fastest growing economies However the country ranks 139th in the world in nominal GDP per capita and 118th in GDP per capita at PPP Until 1991 all Indian governments followed protectionist policies that were influenced by socialist economics Widespread state intervention and regulation largely walled the economy off from the outside world An acute balance of payments crisis in 1991 forced the nation to liberalise its economy since then it has moved slowly towards a free market system by emphasising both foreign trade and direct investment inflows India has been a member of WTO since 1 January 1995

United States India s consumer market the world s eleventh largest is expected to become fifth largest by 2030 Increasing access to electricity and clean cooking have been the priorities for energy in India the country s coal is a major cause of greenhouse gas emissions by India but the country s renewable energy is competing strongly Driven by growth India s nominal GDP per capita increased steadily from US 329 in 1991 when economic liberalisation began to US 1 265 in 2010 to an estimated US 1 723 in 2016 It is expected to grow to US 2 358 by 2020 However it has remained lower than those of other Asian developing countries like Indonesia Malaysia Philippines Sri Lanka and Thailand and is expected to remain so in the near future Its GDP per capita is higher than Pakistan Nepal Afghanistan and others According to a 2011 PricewaterhouseCoopers PwC report India s GDP at purchasing power parity could overtake that of the United States by 2045 During the next four decades Indian GDP is expected to grow at an annualised average of 8 making it potentially the world s fastest growing major economy until 2050 The report highlights key growth factors a young and rapidly growing working age population growth in the manufacturing sector because of rising education and engineering skill levels and sustained growth of the consumer market driven by a rapidly growing middle class

challenges Despite economic growth during recent decades India continues to face socio economic challenges In 2006 India contained the largest number of people living below the World Bank s international poverty line of US 1 25 per day The proportion decreased from 60 in 1981 to 42 in 2005 Under the World Bank s later revised poverty line it was 21 in 2011 30 7 of India s children under the age of five are underweight According to a Food and Agriculture Organization report in 2015 15 of the population is undernourished The Mid Day Meal Scheme attempts to lower these rates According to a 2016 Walk Free Foundation report there were an estimated 18 3 million people in India or 1 4 of the population living in the forms of modern slavery such as bonded labour child labour human trafficking and forced begging among others According to the 2011 census there were 10 1 million child labourers in the country a decline of 2 6 million from 12 6 million in 2001 Since 1991 economic inequality between India s states has consistently grown the per capita net state domestic product of the richest states in 2007 was 3 2 times that of the poorest Corruption in India is perceived to have decreased According to the Corruption Perceptions Index India ranked 78th out of 180 countries in 2018 with a score of 41 out of 100 an improvement from 85th in 2014 Demographics languages and

1951 counted 361 million people Medical advances made in the last 50 years as well as increased agricultural productivity brought about by the Green Revolution have caused India s population to grow rapidly The average life expectancy in India is at 68 years 69 6 years for women 67 3 years for men There are around 50 physicians per 100 000 Indians Migration from rural to urban areas has been an important dynamic in India s recent history The number of people living in urban areas grew by 31 2 between 1991 and 2001 Yet in 2001 over 70 still lived in rural areas The level of urbanisation increased further from 27 81 in the 2001 Census to 31 16 in the 2011 Census The slowing down of the overall population growth rate was due to the sharp decline in the growth rate in rural areas since 1991 According to the 2011 census there are 53 million plus urban agglomerations in India among them Mumbai Delhi Kolkata Chennai Bangalore Hyderabad and Ahmedabad in decreasing order by population The literacy rate in 2011 was 74 04 65 46 among females and 82 14 among males The rural urban literacy gap which was 21 2 percentage points in 2001 dropped to 16 1 percentage points in 2011 The improvement in the rural literacy rate is twice that of urban areas Kerala is the most literate state with 93 91 literacy while Bihar the least with 63 82 India is home to two major language families Indo Aryan spoken by about 74 of the population and Dravidian spoken by 24 of the population Other languages spoken in India come from the Austroasiatic and Sino Tibetan language families India has no national language Hindi with the largest number of speakers is the official language of the government English is used extensively in business and administration and has the status of a subsidiary official language it is important in education especially as a medium of higher education Each state and union territory has one or more official languages and the constitution recognises in particular 22 scheduled languages The 2011 census reported the religion in India with the largest number of followers was Hinduism 79 80 of the population followed by Islam 14 23 the remaining were Christianity 2 30 Sikhism 1 72 Buddhism 0 70 Jainism 0 36 and others 0 9 India has the third largest Muslim population the largest for a non Muslim majority country Culture Indian cultural history spans more than 4 500 years During the Vedic period c 1700 c 500 BCE the foundations of Hindu philosophy mythology theology and literature were laid and many beliefs and practices which still exist today such as dhárma kárma yóga and mokṣa were established India is notable for its religious diversity with Hinduism Buddhism Sikhism Islam Christianity and Jainism among the nation s major religions The predominant religion Hinduism has been shaped by various historical schools of thought including those of the Upanishads the Yoga Sutras the Bhakti movement and by Buddhist philosophy Visual art India has a very ancient tradition of art which has exchanged many influences with the rest of Eurasia especially in the first millennium when Buddhist art spread with Indian religions to Central East and South East Asia the last also greatly influenced by Hindu art Thousands of seals from the Indus Valley Civilization have been found usually carved with animals but a few with human figures The Pashupati seal is the best known After this there is a long period with virtually nothing surviving after which almost all surviving ancient Indian art is in various forms of religious sculpture in durable materials or coins There there was probably originally far more in wood which is lost In north India Mauryan art is the first imperial movement and the Lion Capital of Sarnath from about 250 BCE is now India s national symbol Over the following centuries a distinct Indian style of sculpting the human figure developed with less interest in articulating precise anatomy than ancient Greek sculpture but showing smoothly flowing forms expressing prana breath or life force This is often complicated by the need to give figures multiple arms or heads or represent different genders on the left and right of figures as with the Ardhanarishvara form of Shiva and Parvati Most of the earliest large sculpture is Buddhist either excavated from Buddhist stupas such as Sanchi Sarnath and Amaravati or is rock cut reliefs at sites such as Ajanta Karla and Ellora Hindu and Jain sites appear rather later In spite of this complex mixture of religious traditions generally the prevailing artistic style at any time and place has been shared by the major religious groups and sculptors probably usually served all communities Gupta art at its peak between about 300 CE and 500 CE is often regarded as a classical period whose influence lingered for many centuries after it saw a new dominance of Hindu sculpture as at the Elephanta Caves Across the north this became rather stiff and formulaic after about 800 CE though rich with finely carved detail in the surrounds of statues But in the South under the Pallava and Chola dynasties sculpture in both stone and bronze had a sustained period of great achievement the large bronzes with Shiva as Nataraja have become an iconic symbol of India Ancient painting has only survived at a few sites of which the crowded scenes of court life in the Ajanta Caves are by far the most important but it was evidently highly developed and is mentioned as a courtly accomplishment in Gupta times Painted manuscripts of religious texts survive from Eastern India about the 10th century onwards most of the earliest being Buddhist and later Jain No doubt the style of these was used in larger paintings The Persian derived Deccan painting starting just before the Mughal miniature between them give the first large body of secular painting with an emphasis on portraits and the recording of princely pleasures and wars The style spread to Hindu courts especially among the Rajputs and developed a variety of styles with the smaller courts often the most innovative with figures such as Nihâl Chand and Nainsukh As a market developed among European residents it was supplied by Company painting by Indian artists with considerable Western influence In the 19th century cheap Kalighat paintings of gods and everyday life done on paper were urban folk art from Calcutta which later saw the Bengal School of Art reflecting the art colleges founded by the British the first movement in modern Indian painting Architecture and literature Much of Indian architecture including the Taj Mahal other works of Mughal architecture and South Indian architecture blends ancient local traditions with imported styles Vernacular architecture is also regional in its flavours Vastu shastra literally science of construction or architecture and ascribed to Mamuni Mayan explores how the laws of nature affect human dwellings it employs precise geometry and directional alignments to reflect perceived cosmic constructs As applied in Hindu temple architecture it is influenced by the Shilpa Shastras a series of foundational texts whose basic mythological form is the Vastu Purusha mandala a square that embodied the absolute The Taj Mahal built in Agra between 1631 and 1648 by orders of Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife has been described in the UNESCO World Heritage List as the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world s heritage Indo Saracenic Revival architecture developed by the British in the late 19th century drew on Indo Islamic architecture The earliest literature in India composed between 1500 BCE and 1200 CE was in the Sanskrit language Major works of Sanskrit literature include the Rigveda c 1500 BCE 1200 BCE the epics Mahābhārata c 400 BCE 400 CE and the Ramayana c 300 BCE and later Abhijñānaśākuntalam The Recognition of Śakuntalā and other dramas of Kālidāsa c 5th century CE and Mahākāvya poetry In Tamil literature the Sangam literature c 600 BCE 300 BCE consisting of 2 381 poems composed by 473 poets is the earliest work From the 14th to the 18th centuries India s literary traditions went through a period of drastic change because of the emergence of devotional poets like Kabīr Tulsīdās and Guru Nānak This period was characterised by a varied and wide spectrum of thought and expression as a consequence medieval Indian literary works differed significantly from classical traditions In the 19th century Indian writers took a new interest in social questions and psychological descriptions In the 20th century Indian literature was influenced by the works of the Bengali poet author and philosopher Rabindranath Tagore who was a recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature Performing arts and media Indian music ranges over various traditions and regional styles Classical music encompasses two genres and their various folk offshoots the northern Hindustani and southern Carnatic schools Regionalised popular forms include filmi and folk music the syncretic tradition of the bauls is a well known form of the latter Indian dance also features diverse folk and classical forms Among the better known folk dances are the bhangra of Punjab the bihu of Assam the Jhumair and chhau of Jharkhand Odisha and West Bengal garba and dandiya of Gujarat ghoomar of Rajasthan and the lavani of Maharashtra Eight dance forms many with narrative forms and mythological elements have been accorded classical dance status by India s National Academy of Music Dance and Drama These are bharatanatyam of the state of Tamil Nadu kathak of Uttar Pradesh kathakali and mohiniyattam of Kerala kuchipudi of Andhra Pradesh manipuri of Manipur odissi of Odisha and the sattriya of Assam Theatre in India melds music dance and improvised or written dialogue Often based on Hindu mythology but also borrowing from medieval romances or social and political events Indian theatre includes the bhavai of Gujarat the jatra of West Bengal the nautanki and ramlila of North India tamasha of Maharashtra burrakatha of Andhra Pradesh terukkuttu of Tamil Nadu and the yakshagana of Karnataka India has a theatre training institute the National School of Drama NSD that is situated at New Delhi It is an autonomous organisation under the Ministry of Culture Government of India The Indian film industry produces the world s most watched cinema Established regional cinematic traditions exist in the Assamese Bengali Bhojpuri Hindi Kannada Malayalam Punjabi Gujarati Marathi Odia Tamil and Telugu languages The Hindi language film industry Bollywood is the largest sector representing 43 of box office revenue followed by the South Indian Telugu and Tamil film industries which represent 36 combined Television broadcasting began in India in 1959 as a state run medium of communication and expanded slowly for more than two decades The state monopoly on television broadcast ended in the 1990s Since then satellite channels have increasingly shaped the popular culture of Indian society Today television is the most penetrative media in India industry estimates indicate that as of 2012 there are over 554 million TV consumers 462 million with satellite or cable connections compared to other forms of mass media such as the press 350 million radio 156 million or internet 37 million Society Traditional Indian society is sometimes defined by social hierarchy The Indian caste system embodies much of the social stratification and many of the social restrictions found in the Indian subcontinent Social classes are defined by thousands of endogamous hereditary groups often termed as jātis or castes India declared untouchability to be illegal in 1947 and has since enacted other anti discriminatory laws and social welfare initiatives Family values are important in the Indian tradition and multi generational patriarchal joint families have been the norm in India though nuclear families are becoming common in urban areas An overwhelming majority of Indians with their consent have their marriages arranged by their parents or other family elders Marriage is thought to be for life and the divorce rate is extremely low with less than one in a thousand marriages ending in divorce Child marriages are common especially in rural areas many women wed before reaching 18 which is their legal marriageable age Female infanticide in India and lately female foeticide have created skewed gender ratios the number of missing women in the country quadrupled from 15 million to 63 million in the 50 year period ending in 2014 faster than the population growth during the same period and constituting 20 percent of India s female electorate Accord to an Indian government study an additional 21 million girls are unwanted and do not receive adequate care Despite a government ban on sex selective foeticide the practice remains commonplace in India the result of a preference for boys in a patriarchal society The payment of dowry although illegal remains widespread across class lines Deaths resulting from dowry mostly from bride burning are on the rise despite stringent anti dowry laws Many Indian festivals are religious in origin The best known include Diwali Ganesh Chaturthi Thai Pongal Holi Durga Puja Eid ul Fitr Bakr Id Christmas and Vaisakhi Education In the 2011 census about 73 of the population was literate with 81 for men and 65 for women This compares to 1981 when the respective rates were 41 53 and 29 In 1951 the rates were 18 27 and 9 In 1921 the rates 7 12 and 2 In 1891 they were 5 9 and 1 According to Latika Chaudhary in 1911 there were under three primary schools for every ten villages Statistically more caste and religious diversity reduced private spending Primary schools taught literacy so local diversity limited its growth In 2019 India had over 900 universities and 40 000 colleges In India s higher education system a significant number of seats are reserved under affirmative action policies for the historically disadvantaged In recent decades India s improved education system is often cited as one of the main contributors to its economic development Clothing The most widely worn traditional dress in India for both women and men from ancient times until the advent of modern times was draped For women it eventually took the form of a sari a single long piece of cloth famously six yards long and of width spanning the lower body The sari is tied around the waist and knotted at one end wrapped around the lower body and then over the shoulder In its more modern form it has been used to cover the head and sometimes the face as a veil It has been combined with an underskirt or Indian petticoat and tucked in the waist band for more secure fastening It is also commonly worn with an Indian blouse or choli which serves as the primary upper body garment the sari s end passing over the shoulder serving to obscure the upper body s contours and to cover the midriff For men a similar but shorter length of cloth the dhoti has served as a lower body garment It too is tied around the waist and wrapped In south India it is usually wrapped around the lower body the upper end tucked in the waistband the lower left free In addition in northern India it is also wrapped once around each leg before being brought up through the legs to be tucked in at the back Other forms of traditional apparel that involve no stitching or tailoring are the chaddar a shawl worn by both sexes to cover the upper body during colder weather or a large veil worn by women for framing the head or covering it and the pagri a turban or a scarf worn around the head as a part of a tradition or to keep off the sun or the cold Until the beginning of the first millennium CE the ordinary dress of people in India was entirely unstitched The arrival of the Kushans from Central Asia circa 48 CE popularised cut and sewn garments in the style of Central Asian favoured by the elite in northern India However it was not until Muslim rule was established first with the Delhi sultanate and then the Mughal Empire that the range of stitched clothes in India grew and their use became significantly more widespread Among the various garments gradually establishing themselves in northern India during medieval and early modern times and now commonly worn are the shalwars and pyjamas both forms of trousers as well as the tunics kurta and kameez In southern India however the traditional draped garments were to see much longer continuous use Shalwars are atypically wide at the waist but narrow to a cuffed bottom They are held up by a drawstring or elastic belt which causes them to become pleated around the waist The pants can be wide and baggy or they can be cut quite narrow on the bias in which case they are called churidars The kameez is a long shirt or tunic The side seams are left open below the waist line which gives the wearer greater freedom of movement The kameez is usually cut straight and flat older kameez use traditional cuts modern kameez are more likely to have European inspired set in sleeves The kameez may have a European style collar a Mandarin collar or it may be collarless in the latter case its design as a women s garment is similar to a kurta At first worn by Muslim women the use of shalwar kameez gradually spread making them a regional style especially in the Punjab region A kurta which traces its roots to Central Asian nomadic tunics has evolved stylistically in India as a garment for everyday wear as well as for formal occasions It is traditionally made of cotton or silk it is worn plain or with embroidered decoration such as chikan and it can be loose or tight in the torso typically falling either just above or somewhere below the wearer s knees The sleeves of a traditional kurta fall to the wrist without narrowing the ends hemmed but not cuffed the kurta can be worn by both men and women it is traditionally collarless though standing collars are increasingly popular and it can be worn over ordinary pyjamas loose shalwars churidars or less traditionally over jeans In the last 50 years fashions have changed a great deal in India Increasingly in urban settings in northern India the sari is no longer the apparel of everyday wear transformed instead into one for formal occasions The traditional shalwar kameez is rarely worn by younger women who favour churidars or jeans The kurtas worn by young men usually fall to the shins and are seldom plain In white collar office settings ubiquitous air conditioning allows men to wear sports jackets year round For weddings and formal occasions men in the middle and upper classes often wear bandgala or short Nehru jackets with pants with the groom and his groomsmen sporting sherwanis and churidars The dhoti the once universal garment of Hindu India the wearing of which in the homespun and handwoven form of khadi allowed Gandhi to bring Indian nationalism to the millions is seldom seen in the cities reduced now with brocaded border to the liturgical vestments of Hindu priests Cuisine Indian cuisine consists of a wide variety of regional and traditional cuisines Given the range of diversity in soil type climate culture ethnic groups and occupations these cuisines vary substantially from each other using locally available spices herbs vegetables and fruit Indian foodways have been influenced by religion in particular Hindu cultural choices and traditions They have been also shaped by Islamic rule particularly that of the Mughals by the arrival of the Portuguese on India s southwestern shores and by British rule These three influences are reflected respectively in the dishes of pilaf and biryani the vindaloo and the tiffin and the Railway mutton curry Earlier the Columbian exchange had brought the potato the tomato maize peanuts cashew nuts pineapples guavas and most notably chilli peppers to India Each became staples of use In turn the spice trade between India and Europe was a catalyst for Europe s Age of Discovery The cereals grown in India their choice times and regions of planting correspond strongly to the timing of India s monsoons and the variation across regions in their associated rainfall In general the broad division of cereal zones in India as determined by their dependence on rain was firmly in place before the arrival of artificial irrigation Rice which requires a lot of water has been grown traditionally in regions of high rainfall in the northeast and the western coast wheat in regions of moderate rainfall like India s northern plains and millet in regions of low rainfall such as on the Deccan Plateau and in Rajasthan The foundation of a typical Indian meal is a cereal cooked in plain fashion and complemented with flavourful savoury dishes The latter includes lentils pulses and vegetables spiced commonly with ginger and garlic but also more discerningly with a combination of spices that may include coriander cumin turmeric cinnamon cardamon and others as informed by culinary conventions In an actual meal this mental representation takes the form of a platter or thali with a central place for the cooked cereal peripheral ones often in small bowls for the flavourful accompaniments and the simultaneous rather than piecemeal ingestion of the two in each act of eating whether by actual mixing for example of rice and lentils or in the folding of one such as bread around the other such as cooked vegetables A notable feature of Indian food is the existence of a number of distinctive vegetarian cuisines each a feature of the geographical and cultural histories of its adherents The appearance of ahimsa or the avoidance of violence toward all forms of life in many religious orders early in Indian history especially Upanishadic Hinduism Buddhism and Jainism is thought to have been a notable factor in the prevalence of vegetarianism among a segment of India s Hindu population especially in southern India Gujarat and the Hindi speaking belt of north central India as well as among Jains Among these groups strong discomfort is felt at thoughts of eating meat and contributes to the low proportional consumption of meat to overall diet in India Unlike China which has increased its per capita meat consumption substantially in its years of increased economic growth in India the strong dietary traditions have contributed to dairy rather than meat becoming the preferred form of animal protein consumption accompanying higher economic growth In the last millennium the most significant import of cooking techniques into India occurred during the Mughal Empire The cultivation of rice had spread much earlier from India to Central and West Asia however it was during Mughal rule that dishes such as the pilaf developed in the interim during the Abbasid caliphate and cooking techniques such as the marinating of meat in yogurt spread into northern India from regions to its northwest To the simple yogurt marinade of Persia onions garlic almonds and spices began to be added in India Rice grown to the southwest of the Mughal capital Agra which had become famous in the Islamic world for its fine grain was partially cooked and layered alternately with the sauteed meat the pot sealed tightly and slow cooked according to another Persian cooking technique to produce what has today become the Indian biryani a feature of festive dining in many parts of India In food served in restaurants in urban north India and internationally the diversity of Indian food has been partially concealed by the dominance of Punjabi cuisine This was caused in large part by an entrepreneurial response among people from the Punjab region who had been displaced by the 1947 partition of India and had arrived in India as refugees The identification of Indian cuisine with the tandoori chicken cooked in the tandoor oven which had traditionally been used for baking bread in the rural Punjab and the Delhi region especially among Muslims but which is originally from Central Asia dates to this period Sports and recreation Cricket is the most popular sport in India Major domestic competitions include the Indian Premier League which is the most watched cricket league in the world and ranks sixth among all sports leagues Several traditional indigenous sports remain fairly popular such as kabaddi kho kho pehlwani and gilli danda Some of the earliest forms of Asian martial arts such as Kalarippayattu musti yuddha silambam and marma adi originated in India Chess commonly held to have originated in India as chaturaṅga is regaining widespread popularity with the rise in the number of Indian grandmasters Pachisi from which parcheesi derives was played on a giant marble court by Akbar The improved results garnered by the Indian Davis Cup team and other Indian tennis players in the early 2010s have made tennis increasingly popular in the country India has a comparatively strong presence in shooting sports and has won several medals at the Olympics the World Shooting Championships and the Commonwealth Games Other sports in which Indians have succeeded internationally include badminton Saina Nehwal and P V Sindhu are two of the top ranked female badminton players in the world boxing and wrestling Football is popular in West Bengal Goa Tamil Nadu Kerala and the north eastern states India has hosted or co hosted several international sporting events the 1951 and 1982 Asian Games the 1987 1996 and 2011 Cricket World Cup tournaments the 2003 Afro Asian Games the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy the 2010 Hockey World Cup the 2010 Commonwealth Games and the 2017 FIFA U 17 World Cup Major international sporting events held annually in India include the Chennai Open the Mumbai Marathon the Delhi Half Marathon and the Indian Masters The first Formula 1 Indian Grand Prix featured in late 2011 but has been discontinued from the F1 season calendar since 2014 India has traditionally been the dominant country at the South Asian Games An example of this dominance is the basketball competition where the Indian team won three out of four tournaments to date See also Outline of India Notes
