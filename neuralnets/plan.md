Minimizing Functions
====================

1. What does it mean to minimize a function?
	* Minimizing a function vs minimizing it's output
	* Why not maximize?
	* Inputs, outputs and _parameters_ of a function
2. Minimizing functions with derivatives:
	* Symbolic differentiation
	* Numerical differentiation
	* Automatic gradients - the computation Graph
	* Gradient Descent
